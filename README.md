## Description

Welcome to the `SnakeRiverIPTDS` repository! The repo contains document,
data, code, etc. related to Instream PIT Tag Detection Systems (IPTDS)
throughout the Snake River basin and is a companion to the
`SnakeRiverFishStatus` repo found
[here](https://github.com/NPTfisheries/SnakeRiverFishStatus). Currently,
the repo contains info to support prioritization among IPTDS in the
Snake River basin, data and scripts to evaluate performance of IPTDS
(e.g., virtual test tags), produces a leaflet and [Shiny
website](https://nptfisheries.shinyapps.io/sr-iptds/) of Snake River
IPTDS, and contains data and scripts to summarize available habitat in
ICTRT sp/sum Chinook salmon and steelhead populations, including
available habitat being monitored by IPTDS. The repo will continue to
evolve to include additional information to better understand IPTDS
performance and monitoring.

`SnakeRiverIPTDS` is a collaborative project, with the primary
contributor being Mike Ackerman (Nez Perce Tribe - Department of
Fisheries Resource Management). However, the project relies on data,
hard work, and discussions from many collaborator and weâ€™d like to thank

Wildlife Department, and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife,
among others I may have missed. Moreover, the Snake River IPTDS process
is a highly collaborative effort and co-authors include:
